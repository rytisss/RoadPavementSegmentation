# RoadPavementSegmentation
Repository for all the material related to road pavements defect segmentation. Main idea behind the segmentation is to create/approve/test various architectures (modification of autoencoders, such as U-Net and its modifications) to find the best to do the task. 

Solutions:
1. UNet
2. ResUNet
2. ResUNet with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling
3. ResUNet with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling ("Waterfall" connections)
4. ResUNet with Attention Gates

Third-party library priorities: 
1. Tensorflow (with Keras frontend)
2. OpenCV
3. Many nifty things related to Python programming language
